# Fastest Lane Follower
 This project involves the design and development of a lane-following robot, an autonomous robot capable of detecting and following a predefined path using a sensor array. The robot employs a PID algorithm for precise speed control and smooth cornering, ensuring accurate and efficient lane navigation.
